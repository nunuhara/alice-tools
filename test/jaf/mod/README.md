Mod Tests
---------

In order to run these tests, you must first copy your "Dohna Dohna" and "Rance 10" game
directories to `dohna/` and `rance10/` respectively. Then run `build.sh` to build the modified
.ain files.

The tests can be run via wine using the `dohna.sh` and `rance10.sh` scripts. Or you can just
open the game's .exe in the `dohna/`/`rance10/` directories on Windows.

If the game runs without raising an assertion, then the tests passed.
